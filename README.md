# Overview
**SimpleBoolean** is a 3D Mesh Boolean Library based on the following papers,
- [Simple and Robust Boolean Operations for Triangulated Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4434v2)  
- [Efficient Collision Detection of Complex Deformable Models using AABB Trees](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~djames/pbmis/etc/jgt98deform_AABB.pdf)  

**not finish yet**, will be used in [Dust3D](https://dust3d.org/) software to replace the CGAL equivalent CSG function.
